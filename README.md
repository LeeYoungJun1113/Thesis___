My Thesis aimed to evaluate the Deep Learning-based segmentation on Covid-19 CT imaging for distinguishing from other diseases.
In this page, I easily elucidate to build up my codebase for the thesis step by step.

The Thesis overview is as follows.
Time Schedule (26 weeks plan, 5/10 ~ 11/10 for result)

5.10 – 6.10; Describing casual scheme, data collection, Analyzing key two references 
(Data size;  Covid-19 shape; focal, invasive,  Data types-DICOM, tiff, j-son etc)

6.10 – 8.10; modeling,
(Application networks - Fundamental U-net, FCN, Seg-net etc Programming software – Colab, Python)

8.10 – 9.10; Data analysis with outputs - MATLAB

9.10 – 10.10 Feedback, advancing for high performance

10.11 – 11.11 Summarizing the results (Tables, Figures) and Starting Thesis.
